## Why ScrollX UI?

Unlike traditional UI libraries, **ScrollX UI** offers:

### **Open Code**

Every component is fully open-source and customizable. You’re never boxed in—fork, modify, or extend components as your project grows.

### **Composition**

Built using a clean, composable pattern (Root / Trigger / Content), components remain consistent and developer-friendly across your app.

### **Distribution**

No lock-ins or obscure bundling. Use components directly from flat files across repositories or teams, ensuring a plug-and-play developer experience.

### **Beautiful Defaults**

Each component is styled with modern design principles and comes accessibility-ready, allowing you to go live with minimal configuration.

### **AI-Ready**

ScrollX UI is built for the next generation of AI-assisted coding. Whether you're using AI to scaffold UIs or refactor them, ScrollX components are structured for easy parsing and regeneration.
